## College Degrees: Costs vs. Returns

College education often comes with a hefty price tag. However, the pertinent question is: does the investment yield significant returns? Majors like Philosophy or International Relations might have given your parents pause, but is their apprehension backed by actual data? Over the span of a year, PayScale Inc. conducted a survey involving 1.2 million Americans, all of whom possessed only a bachelor's degree. Leveraging the power of Pandas, we aim to explore this data and address the following queries:

- **Which degrees command the highest initial salaries?**

- **Which disciplines result in the lowest post-college earnings?**

- **Which educational pathways present the greatest earning potential?**

- **From an earnings perspective, which college majors are considered the least risky?**

- **On average, which fields yield better returns â€” Business, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), or HASS (Humanities, Arts, Social Science)?**
